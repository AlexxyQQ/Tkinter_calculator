## Design and Functions

The calculator is capable of handling basic operations and also some complex ones like **mod**, **floor division**, and **exponent**.
The calculator is fully equipped with functions like clear ``C`` and backspace ``â‡š``.

## Calculations

### Exponent
It can be used by pressing the multiplication ``*`` button 2 times.

### The calculator can perform all basic calculations as it uses python built-in- function ```eval()```to perform its calculations.
Eval dynamically evaluates expressions from a string-based or compiled-code-based input. If you pass an operation in a string to ```eval()```, then the function parses it, compiles it to bytecode, and evaluates it as a Python expression.

## Future Goals
- ~~function can be added for calculating inverse~~
- ~~keyboard input and live calculation for the keyboard input.~~
- still can't calculate any problems with 0 in the beginning like **(02-2)**
- calculation history can be added.
